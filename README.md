# Reduce fun

Exercises to practice refactoring javascript with functional methodology.
Refactoring code is a skill that can be learnt, in this session we will identify common techniques to leave code in a better state than you found it.

This session is aimed to help us learn new things that we can implement in our daily work to help us solve problems.

## Workshops aims

Refactor some code moving from a for-loop --> map --> reduce --> groupBy with pre-written tests
Implement GroupBy without lodash to understand what it is doing, why and when to use it

# Reduce fun

Exercises to practice refactoring javascript with functional methodology.
Refactoring code is a skill that can be learnt, in this session we will identify common techniques to leave code in a better state than you found it.

This session is aimed to help us learn new things that we can implement in our daily work to help us solve problems.

## Exercises

### Refactor

Refactor some code moving from a for-loop --> map/filter/reduce

- [Exercise 1](/refactor/exercise-1.spec.js)
- [Exercise 2](/refactor/exercise-2.spec.js)
- [Exercise 3](/refactor/exercise-3.spec.js)
- [Exercise 4](/refactor/exercise-4.spec.js)

### GroupBy

Implement GroupBy without lodash to understand what it is doing, why and when to use it.

- [Exercise 1](/groupBy/exercise-1.spec.js)
- [Exercise 2](/groupBy/exercise-2.spec.js)
- [Exercise 3](/groupBy/exercise-3.spec.js)
- [Exercise 4](/groupBy/exercise-4.spec.js)

## Getting started
